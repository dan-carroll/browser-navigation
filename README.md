# browser-navigation-examples
Test and showcase differing current methods of browser navigation.
I started this project when I wanted to add a drop down menu item to my github io page. I broke the theme in my attempt to add the drop down I wanted. The results of my search for the fix I needed gave birth to the creation of this project.
